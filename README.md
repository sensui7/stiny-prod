Personal website for my girlfriend Ciny and me! We take a lot of photos and do a lot of cooking, so I thought it would be a fun idea to learn/relearn a bunch of technologies I've used at previous internships to build something that we'd both use.

*Still a work in progress; some features left to do below:*
- Removing many photos at once
- Editing name for recipe
